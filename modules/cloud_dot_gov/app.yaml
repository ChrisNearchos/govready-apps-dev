    ## Identity and Access Management

    ## Identification and Authentication Policy for 18F


    The cloud.gov platform delegates authentication to either the GSA enterprise system
    or GitHub for any administrator access.

    ## User Account and Authentication (UAA) Server


    The UAA is the identity management service for Cloud Foundry. Its primary role
    is as an OAuth2 provider, issuing tokens for client applications to use when they
    act on behalf of Cloud Foundry users. In collaboration with the login server,
    it authenticates users with their Cloud Foundry credentials, and act as a Single
    Sign-On (SSO) service using those credentials (or others). It has endpoints for
    managing user accounts and for registering OAuth2 clients, as well as various
    other management functions.

    All users have individually unique identifiers to access and authenticates  to
    the environment. Shared or group authenticators are not utilized, with the exception
    of a root administrative account. There are only two authorized users from the
    DevOps team who has access to the root administrative account.

    ## ELKStack


    cloud.gov provides an audit trail through the bosh tasks command which shows all
    actions that an operator has taken with the platform. It also records an audit
    trail of all relevant API invocations of an app. The CLI command cf events returns
    this information.


    ELK ( Logstash, Elasticsearch, Kibana) a front end component for loggregator is
    used to automatically audit all actions within the cloud.gov platform. By binding
    an instance of the service to, cloud.gov applications logs will be drained to
    a Logstash syslog receiver and stored in Elasticsearch to perform real-time data
    analytics with Kibana as the interface for search and visualization.

    ## Cloud Checkr


    #TODO

    18F has implemented CloudWatch for its system account monitoring. It monitors
    resources in near real-time, including EC2 instances, EBS volumes, Elastic Load
    Balancers, and RDS DB instances. Metrics such as CPU utilization, latency, and
    request counts are provided automatically for these AWS resources. It allows 18F
    to supply logs or custom application and system metrics, such as memory usage,
    transaction volumes, or error rates.


    CloudTrail captures all IAM API calls from  command-line tools, the AWS SDK, and
    the AWS Management Console. Monitoring data is retained for two weeks, even if
    AWS resources have been terminated. This enables 18F to quickly look back at the
    metrics preceding an event of interest.


    Metrics are accessed in either the EC2 tab or the CloudWatch tab of the AWS Management
    Console. SecOps personnel monitors the use of all infrastructure accounts through
    Cloud Checkr

    ## JumpBox


    18F authorizes the execution of privileged commands and access to security-relevant
    information via remote access only for monitoring, managing, and troubleshooting 
    the 18F virtual infrastructure and cloud.gov platform. This authorization is only
    given to specific members of the DevOps and SecOps teams. All other members are
    excluded from this type of access.


    Since the cloud.gov platform resides within the 18F virtual infrastructure, 18F
    DevOps must use the SSH remote access method to troubleshoot issues and update
    services that are only resolved by logging into the cloud.gov jumpboxes. The jumpbox
    itself a virtual machine deployed within the cloud.gov virtual private cloud.
    It is the only access point for designated DevOps members to run privileged commands
    that affect the entire platform. No other privileged remote access is available

    ## System and Services Acquisition Policy for 18F


    cloud.gov uses the Cloud Foundry secure deployment best practices, which include
    the following:
      - Configure UAA clients and users using a standard BOSH manifest for Cloud Foundry
    Development.
      - cloud.gov develops and maintains documentation on the baseline configuration
    of the information system that include network topology, system architecture,
    application, web, and server components along with software standards.
      - Cloud Foundry protects the information system from security threats by minimizing
    network surface area, applying security controls, isolating applications and data
    in containers, and encrypting connections.
      - It also implements role-based access controls, applying and enforcing permissions
    to isolate user to their space.  Baseline configurations settings are reviewed
    on a continual basis to to comply with federal mandates and compliance standards.
      - cloud.gov documents changes to the baseline configuration in GitHub for review.
    Part of this process includes a thorough security analysis of the proposed change
    prior to the configuration change being implemented on the operational system.
      - cloud.gov deploys with every application a standard set of tools for security
    and monitoring of each application to identify security issues.
    For more details please refer to 18F Configuration Management Policy and security
    controls CM-2, CM-3, and CM-6.

    ## Configuration Management Policy for 18F


    Configuration management at the AWS level is managed through CloudFormation automation
    templates, AWS Config and

    VisualOps. 18F maintains baseline configurations for VPC, EBS, EC2 instances and
    AMIs. AWS Cloud Formation templates

    help maintains a strict configuration management scheme of the cloud.gov. Because
    these templates are text files, 18F

    can simply track differences in these templates to track changes to its infrastructure.


    For cloud.gov, an operator initiates a new deployment using the BOSH CLI, the
    BOSH Director receives a version of the

    deployment manifest and creates a new deployment using this manifest. Automated
    Configuration of cloud.gov platform

    components is handled by the Concourse.ci, a continuous integration and deployment
    tool which utilizes the cloud.gov

    customized Ubuntu stemcells and deployment manifest yaml files for its baseline
    configurations.

    ## SecureProxy

    cloud.gov forces https using SecureProxy:

    Applications running on Cloud Foundry receive requests through the URLs configured
    for the application. HTTP requests arrive on ports 80 and 443. Additionally, Cloud
    Foundry requires a channel for TCP/WebSocket traffic. The default cf-release manifest
    assigns port 4443 for TCP/WebSocket communications.

    All traffic from the public internet to the Cloud Controller and UAA happens over
    HTTPS. Inside the boundary of the system, components communicate over publish-subscribe
    (pub-sub) message bus, NATs on port 4222.

    To combat spoofing Cloud Foundry network traffic rules help prevent the attack
    from accessing application containers. Cloud Foundry uses application isolation,
    operating system restrictions, and encrypted connections to further mitigate risk.

    Application developers push their code using the Cloud Foundry API. Cloud Foundry
    secures each call to the CF API using the UAA and SSL
    ## System and Communications Protection Policy for cloud.gov

    cloud.gov inherits the control from the GovCloud package for the ELB SSL termination. See https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/compliance/AWS_Risk_and_Compliance_Whitepaper.pdf for further details.
    ## User Account and Authentication (UAA) Server

    As for stored data the following cryptographic mechanisms are used to prevent unauthorized disclosure and modification of stored data.
    Operators configure encryption of the identity store in the UAA. When users register an account with the Cloud Foundry platform, the UAA acts as the user store and stores user passwords in the UAA database using bcrypt, a blowfish encryption algorithm, which enables Cloud Foundry to store a secure hash of user passwords.
    The Cloud Controller stores the configuration for an application in an encrypted database table. This configuration data includes user-specified environment variables and service credentials for any services bound to the app.

    ## Identity and Access Management
    ## ELKStack

    ### Part g

    The UAA API interface is used to monitor privileged/non privileged user accounts within the cloud.gov It lists Cloud Foundry instance users. By default it returns information about each user account including GUID, name, permission groups, activity status, and metadata.

    18F uses the ELK stack to provide a visual way to monitor all user and system accounts within cloud.gov by interfacing with cloud.gov API calls to its internal system components (i.e. Loggregator, Cloud Controller, DEA, Warden, Metrics Collector)
    ## Cloud Checkr

    ### Part j

    User accounts will be monitored monthly and accounts will be disabled after 90 days of inactivity; this will be a manual review process every 30 days. 18F is in the process of automating this account management process through the use of implementing AWS OSQuery to trigger alerts when user accounts are inactive of a 90-day period.
    ## User Account and Authentication (UAA) Server

    ### Part j

    User accounts will be monitored monthly and accounts will be disabled after 90 days of inactivity; this will be a manual review process every 30 days, but the disablement will be automatic. A manual review of all user accounts will be conducted on an annual basis

    ## Cloud Formation
    ## Cloud Checkr

    ### Part c

    For changes related to the virtual infrastructure, 18F uses VisualOps and Cloud Checkr for real-time configuration changes which are documented, approved and tracked within GitHub. All Cloud Foundry configuration changes are documented, approved and tracked within 18F's GitHub site.
    ## Configuration Management Policy for 18F

    ### Part a

    All Configuration Change control:
    18F provisions its infrastructure with AWS CloudFormation, the AWS CloudFormation
    template describes exactly what resources are provisioned and their settings.
    Because these templates are text files, 18F can simply track differences in
    these templates to track changes to its infrastructure, similar to the way
    developers control revisions to source code.

    18F uses version control systems with its cloud formation templates to know
    exactly what changes were made, who made them, and when. If at any point 18F
    needs to reverse changes to infrastructure, you can use a previous version of
    a template.

    18F uses GitHub for additional tracking and documenting of authorized changes
    within the infrastructure and applications including Cloud Foundry platform as
    a service. Within GitHub, a diff function is used to compare and contrast any
    changes made to configurations of Cloud Foundry.

    ### Part b

    18F reviews proposed configuration-controlled changes to all of its information
    systems and infrastructure and approves or disapproves such changes with explicit
    consideration for security impact analysis within the Virtual Private Cloud
    environment. All reviews and approvals are conducted within 18Fs GitHub ticketing
    and tracking system.

    ### Part c

    18F uses the following methods to document configuration change decisions
    associated with its information systems.  For changes related to the its
    virtual infrastructure, 18F uses VisualOps and Cloud Checkr for real-time
    configuration changes which are documented, approved and tracked within GitHub.
    All Cloud Foundry configuration changes are documented, approved and tracked
    within 18F's GitHub site.  All configuration changes related to applications
    and websites hosted within the 18F AWS and Cloud Foundry environment are
    requested by the systems owner and approved by cloud.gov operators within the 18F GitHub
    tracking systems.

    ### Part d

    When configuration changes have been approved through 18F's GitHub
    ticketing and tracking system, the cloud.gov operators team implements approved configuration-controlled
    changes to the information system and then provides a status of the changes
    completed and closes out the ticket.

    ### Part e

    Records of configuration-controlled
    changes are retained for at least 1 year in accordance with the 18F Configuration
    Management policy and utilizing the 18F GitHub site and S3 to store all changes
    requested, approved, disapproved, implemented and pending.

    ### Part f

    Audits for the virtual infrastructure and Cloud Foundry platform as a
    service and applications are conducted by cloud.gov operators, ISSOs and Cloud Foundry
    project manager of all configuration-controlled changes to the information
    system.  These audits take place no less than once a month and are documented
    in the GitHub ticketing and tracking system, per the 18F Configuration
    management policy Section 3 which states

    18F will conduct a monthly audit of information system which identifies and
    eliminates unnecessary functions, ports, protocols, and/or services.

    ### Part g

    18F coordinates
    and provides oversight for configuration change control activities through its
    GitHub tracking and ticketing systems and Slack communications channel which
    is integrated with GitHub that convenes whenever there are significant and pending
    changes to the 18F security, cloud infrastructure and applications.

    ## Configuration Management Policy for 18F

    18F posts its current inventory of information systems on its dashboard
    located at  https://18f.gsa.gov/dashboard/. Several sources are used to capture
    complete inventories of the virtual infrastructure and its information systems
    while providing the level of granularity deemed necessary for tracking and reporting.
    The AWS Management Console, VisualOps, Cloud Checkr, Github, and Nexpose are used
    to provide additional enumeration capabilities.

    Cloud Checkr is currently deployed to facilitate asset management, along with
    other operations activities, on a real-time ongoing basis. Components deployed
    in the virtual infrastructure are accurately inventoried and can be filtered to
    a specific informaton system groups as well as a group of web services or  those
    components that are related to a spcecific informaton system.

    The VisualOps Cloud management tool is used to provide a visual, real-time and
    automated representation of the virtual infrastructure and applications within
    the 18F environment. It also provides a global view of the 18F AWS account where
    all regions and services can be seen in one place.

    The 18F GitHub repository also is used to show a current lists of components
    that make up the cloud.gov inventory. It is located at https://docs.cloud.gov/ops/repos/

    Nexpose maintains an inventory of all assets scanned within the 18F virtual Private
    Cloud. This includes all information system within the VPCs and components within
    the cloud.gov platform as a service.

    Bosh continuously maintains inventory of all instances and configuration

    cloud.gov operators review and update the information system component inventory
    on a monthly basis and updates the inventory of information system whenever installations,
    removals, and other changes are made. 18F will verify that all components within
    the authorized boundary of the information system are either inventoried as part
    of the system or recognized by another system as a component within that systems
    inventory.

    ## Contingency Planning Policy for 18F

    ### Part a

    cloud.gov will leverage the AWS IaaS for its Alternate storage site capabilities. This implementation employs the use of
    multiple Availability Zones within one AWS Region, which constitute a built-in alternate storage site capability for data
    stored in Amazon S3 and Amazon RDS databases.  S3 uses multiple availability zones by default, and RDS databases deployed
    by this package are replicated across multiple availability zones.

    ### Part b

    Through leveraging the AWS infrastructure as a service 18F ensures that the alternate storage site provides information
    security safeguards equivalent to that of the primary site for Cloud.Gov.  The multiple AWS availability zones employed
    by Amazon S3 storage and Amazon RDS replication provide identical security safeguards.

    ## Incident Response for cloud.gov

    ### Part a

    The cloud.gov team has developed both an Incident Response Guide and checklist to implement incident response capabilities.
    Given the small size of the cloud.gov team, the structure of the incident response process is clear and concise; it assigns the first responder to the event the role of Incident Commander.
    The Incident Response Guide provides clear guidance on what steps to take on each situation and how reporting should be handled.
    The Incident Response Guide empowers the Incident Commander to leverage as many resources from GSA and 18F as needed during the response process.
    The Incident Response Guide is continually reviewed and updated by the cloud.gov team and approved annually by the Authorizing Official.

    ### Part b

    The Incident Response Guide is distributed to the whole of the cloud.gov team.

    ### Part c

    The Incident Response Guide is continually reviewed and updated by the cloud.gov team.

    ## ELKStack


    The Cloud Controller authenticates every request with the Service Broker API using
    HTTP or HTTPS. The cloud.gov operators only uses the BOSH Command Line Interface
    (CLI) to log into the cloud.gov jumpbox using SSH as a remote connection. These
    remote connections are monitored by the cloud.gov Cloud Controller which send
    this data to the ELK logging and monitoring visualization tool stack.

    ## Cloud Checkr


    Cloud Checkr provides a unified view of all infrastructure monitoring which captures
    all remote activities within 18F virtual infrastructure. The log files are organized
    by AWS Account ID, region, service name, date, and time. CloudTrail can be configured
    to aggregate log files from multiple regions into a single Amazon S3 bucket. From
    there, 18F Devops and SecOps teams view the logs files within Cloud Checkr to
    perform security analysis and detect user behavior patterns.

    ## JumpBox


    cloud.gov remote access is not available outside of the 18F environment. 18F DevOps
    personnel are the only group who connects to information system remotely using
    SSH (22) through the jump box (bastion Host) to execute BOSH CLI commands. The
    JumpBox is a virtual machine (VM) that acts as a single access point for the BOSH
    Director and deployed VMs. For resilience there are at least 2 jump boxes. Allowing
    access through jump boxes and disabling direct access to the other VMs is a common
    security measure 18F incorporates.


    The jumbox only serves as a means to execute BOSH CLI commands for the platform.
    It cannot access any applications or websites hosted on top of the platform.


    JumpBoxes are logged in in the same way an EC2 instances is logged into. The system
    has both a firewall and user ssh key logins.


    The 18F Access Control Policy Section 3 - Remote Access states:


    * 18F shall define, document and enforce requirements, usage restrictions and
    implementation guidance for each allowed remote access method.

    * Remote and Virtual Private Network (VPN) access shall require multi-factor authentication.

    * Access shall be authorized before a connection may be established.

    * 18F shall monitor for unauthorized remote access and shall take appropriate
    action if unauthorized access is discovered.

    * Remote access shall employ cryptography to protect session confidentiality and
    integrity.

    * Remote access shall be routed through a limited number of managed access control
    points.

    * Privileged commands and access to security-relevant information via remote access
    shall only be permitted as described in the System Security Plan (SSP).

    ## System and Services Acquisition Policy for 18F


    ### Part a


    18F practices the Scrumban process when developing new features or fixing existing
    issues, including security fixes and enhancements for cloud.gov.  Each feature
    or issue is assigned to a card in the system, where it goes through a process
    of being identified, prioritized, explored, delivered, and finally demonstrated.
    Each card is reviewed by the team as a whole throughout its lifecycle to identify
    any security risks or concerns, which are recorded on the card as "acceptance
    criteria" that must be addressed before development is complete.


    Once development is complete, a team member submits the code to our version control
    system as a "pull request", where at least one other team member further reviews
    it before merging it into the code base.  The team then deploys new features into
    our staging area where they undergo further security review and stakeholder acceptance
    testing, as well as automated acceptance tests.


    ### Part b


    The cloud.gov operations team is broken into several sub-teams with different
    areas of responsibility and expertise.   Security is a foremost concern for members
    of all teams.  The cloud.gov operations team is primarily focused on implementing
    security policies at the platform level.


    ### Part c


    Each member of the cloud.gov operations team has the necessary security background
    to properly handle sensitive data, such as security keys and certificates, and

    Refer to the 18F policy statement for the types of denial of service (DoS) to
    protect our systems against. Policy https://github.com/18f/compliance-docs/blob/master/SC-Policy.md


    cloud.gov limits the effects of Volume Based and Protocol DoS type attacks by
    utilizing the following groups of technical measures:


    18F administrative staff maintains hardened Amazon Managed Images (AMI) and Cloud
    Foundry custom buildpacks with the latest patches and updates.


    Buildpacks provide framework and runtime support for applications that are deployed
    on cloud.gov.  The AMI and custom buildpacks are maintained and secured within
    18F's software repository, GitHub.


    cloud.gov also uses AWS's IaaS services with well-formed Virtual Private Cloud
    (VPC) firewall rules to reduce the attack surface, while service resiliency is
    maintained by utilizing AWS Availability Zones, Elastic Load Balancing, and Auto
    Scaling services.


    Cloud Foundry's security components limit the effects of an attack at the Application
    Layer. It limits DoS attacks on this layer through resource starvation and reduction
    of the attack surface even further with well-formed application security groups
    which control the traffic flowing from hosted applications.


    These tools combined with SOC staffing are responsible for maintaining system
    security.

    ## Cloud Formation
    ## BOSH
    ## Configuration Management Policy for 18F

    For AWS Baseline Configurations:

    AWS Cloud Formation templates, CIS Level 1 benchmarks and any GSA/18F benchmarks such as hardening guidelines
    and baselines are the approved baseline for all changes to the infrastructure and simplify provisioning and management
    on AWS. They provide an automated method to assess the status of an operational infrastructure against an approved
    baseline.

    Windows and Linux instances are based on the standard AWS AMI images in accordance with GSA configuration requirements.

    For cloud.gov Baseline Configurations:

    cloud.gov utilizes customized Ubuntu stemcells and deployment manifest yaml files for its baseline configurations.
    The list of the configuration settings can be found at the following site https://docs.cloud.gov/ops/repos/

    A stemcell is a versioned Operating System image wrapped with IaaS specific packaging. A typical stemcell contains
    a bare minimum OS skeleton with a few common utilities pre-installed, a BOSH Agent, and a few configuration files
    to securely configure the OS by default. With AWS, official stemcells are published as AMIs that can be used in the
    18F AWS account. Stemcells do not contain any specific information about any software that will be installed once
    that stemcell becomes a specialized machine in the cluster; nor do they contain any sensitive information which
    would make them unable to be shared with other BOSH users.  The deployment manifest is a YAML file that defines
    the components and properties of the deployment.

    Note: Additional OS/Device-specific industry standards and guidance may also be used whenever appropriate. It is
    understood that when industry standards are adopted they may need to be adapted for the specific implementation
    and if/where this has occurred it should be mentioned/referenced. 18F ensures that the most current, relevant
    OS/Device-specific industry standards and guidance is maintained where appropriate to support cloud.gov configurations.
    These best practice updates are captured during the annual review of the CM Policy which also incorporates 18 procedures.

    ## System and Communications Protection Policy for cloud.gov


    cloud.gov implements cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure
    and modification of all blobs created by BOSH and Cloud Foundry by implementing
    at-rest encryption and by checking file signatures.

    ## User Account and Authentication (UAA) Server


    The Cloud Foundry platform as a service does NOT create, store or process any
    personally identifiable information (PII) or sensitive information as identified
    by parameter requirement 1.


    Applications running on Cloud Foundry receive requests through the URLs configured
    for the application. HTTP requests arrive on ports 80 and 443. Additionally, Cloud
    Foundry requires a channel for TCP/WebSocket traffic. The default cf-release manifest
    assigns port: 4443 for TCP/WebSocket communications.

    All traffic from the public internet to the Cloud Controller and UAA happens over
    HTTPS. Inside the boundary of the system, components communicate over a publish-subscribe
    (pub-sub) port: 4222 message bus, NATs


    For stored data identified by parameter 2, the following cryptographic mechanisms
    are used to prevent unauthorized disclosure and modification of stored data.

    Operators configure encryption of the identity store in the UAA. When users register
    an account with the Cloud Foundry platform, the UAA, acts as the user store and
    stores user passwords in the UAA database using bcrypt. Bcrypt is a blowfish encryption
    algorithm, which enables cloud foundry to store a secure hash of your users' passwords.

    The Cloud Controller stores the configuration for an application in an encrypted
    database table. This configuration data includes user-specified environment variables
    and service credentials for any services bound to the app.

    Application developers push their code using the Cloud Foundry API. Cloud Foundry
    secures each call to the CF API using the UAA and SSL

    To combat spoofing Cloud Foundry network traffic rules help prevents the attack
    from accessing application containers. Cloud Foundry uses application isolation,
    operating system restrictions, and encrypted connections to further mitigate risk.
