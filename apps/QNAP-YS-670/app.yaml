    QNAP is network attached storage (NAS) device for storing digital files on a network.

    Many organizations use QNAP NAS devices for storing backup copy of files, some of which may contain CUI (Controled Unclassified Information).

    This application will make sure you are properly using QNAP TS-670 (NAS) to protect
    CUI (Controlled Unclassified Information) as per NIST SP 800-171 controls.
