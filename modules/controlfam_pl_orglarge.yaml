      Here are some useful links for understanding Information Security Architecture

      I found "An Introduction to Information Security Architecture" helpful in explaining a “security architecture”:
      "The term 'architecture' is somewhat ambiguous, and can mean different things to different people. Within an IT context, architecture is probably commonly viewed as technology implementation design." - page 3, An Introduction to Information Security Architecture
