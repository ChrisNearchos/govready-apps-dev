      {% if project.system_stack.application_where_hosted != "onpremesis" %}

      Your system is not hosted on premesis and so it does not need a DMZ.

      {% elif using_enterprise_dmz == 'yes' %}
        {% if 0 %}
        {# using_enterprise_dmz_yes is here just to trigger it as something to be answered #}
        {{using_enterprise_dmz_yes}}
        {% endif %}
      
      Your system is using your enterprise DMZ.

      {% else %}

      Your system is not using your enterprise DMZ.

      Reason: {{have_other_dmz.text}}

      {% if have_other_dmz == 'ad_hoc_dmz' %}
      Responsible for DMZ: {{who_responsible_for_dmz}}
