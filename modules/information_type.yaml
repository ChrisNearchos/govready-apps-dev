      Services delivery support functions provide the critical policy, programmatic,
      and managerial foundation to support Federal government operations. Security
      objectives and impact levels for service delivery support information and systems
      are generally determined by the natures of the supported direct services and
      constituencies being supported. If a system stores, processes, or communicates
      national security information, it is defined as a national security system,
      and is outside the scope of this guideline. 12 Service delivery support activities

      Information

      Resource management functions are the back office support activities that enable
      the government to operate effectively. Security objectives and impacts for resource
      management functions are determined by the direct service missions and constituencies
      ultimately being supported. It is likely that all Federal government information
      systems store, process, and operate under the control of IT infrastructure maintenance
      information (e.g., password files and file and network access settings). A basic
      set of security controls will apply to this information and processes to combat
      potential corruption, misuse, or abuse of system information and processes.

      Defense and national security operations protect and advance U.S. National Security
      interests and, if deterrence fails, decisively defeat threats to those interests.
      Defense and national security activities include military operations, border
      protection, and intelligence gathering. Defense operations are subdivided into
      the following sub-elements:

      •


      28


      Strategic National and Theater Defense – Establishing national and multinational

      military objectives, sequencing initiatives, defining limits and assessing risks
      for the use of military and other instruments of national power, developing
      global plans or theater war plans to achieve these objectives, and providing
      military forces and other capabilities in accordance with strategic plans;


      As mode of delivery of mission-based services, the security categorization of
      Direct Services to Citizens subfunctions Military Operations and Civilian Operation
      is dependent on the mission services delivered to the citizens [e.g., Health
      Care; Emergency Response, Environmental Remediation] should be categorized in
      accordance with the mission-based information type.

      •


      •


      Operational Defense – Linking tactics and strategy by establishing operational

      objectives needed to accomplish the strategic objectives, sequencing events
      to

      achieve the operational objectives, initiating actions, and applying resources
      to bring about and sustain these events; and

      Tactical Defense – The ordered arrangement and maneuver of combat elements in

      relation to each other and to the enemy to achieve combat objectives.


      Impacts to information and many information systems associated with defense
      and national security missions may affect the security of a broad range of critical
      infrastructures and key national assets. Systems that, involve command and control
      of military forces, weapons control 29 , involve equipment that is an integral
      part of a weapon or weapons system, are critical to the direct fulfillment of
      military missions or are otherwise employed in strictly military operations
      30 are defined under Public Law as national security systems. National security
      information and national security systems are outside the scope of this guideline.
      Information assurance responsibilities are delegated to the Department of Defense
      for systems that are operated by the Department of Defense, or another entity
      on behalf of the Department of Defense 31 . Security objectives and impact levels
      associated with these systems are determined by the Department of Defense.

      Intelligence operations involve the development and management of accurate,

      comprehensive, and timely foreign intelligence on national security topics.
      Information systems, the function, operation, or use of, which involve intelligence
      activities or are critical to the direct fulfillment of intelligence missions
      32 are defined under Public Law 33 as national security systems. National security
      information and national security systems are outside the scope of this guideline.
      Security objectives and impact levels associated with national security systems
      are determined by the head of each agency exercising control of the system 34
      .

      Intelligence operations are subdivided into the following sub-elements:

      • Intelligence Planning Information Type – Intelligence Planning involves developing


      •

      •


      •

      •


      strategies focused on intelligence requirements, prioritizing these requirements,
      and managing these requirements (adding, deleting and modifying).

      Intelligence Collection Information Type – Intelligence Collection involves
      acquiring raw data and provisioning the data to processing elements.

      Intelligence Analysis and Production Information Type – Intelligence Analysis
      and Production consists of integrating, evaluating, and/or interpreting information
      from single or multiple sources into intelligence satisfying consumer needs
      and preparing intelligence products in support of known or anticipated consumers.

      Intelligence Dissemination Information Type – Intelligence Dissemination consists
      of delivering the intelligence products to consumers.

      Intelligence Processing Information Type – Intelligence processing involves
      converting collected raw data into forms suitable for analysis.


      Some agencies are charged with gathering domestic intelligence. Much domestic
      intelligence information is classified. Other domestic intelligence information
      may not be classified (e.g., some information obtained from state and local
      government sources). All classified information is treated under separate rules
      established for national security information. The recommended categorization
      for unclassified domestic intelligence information follows:

      Security Category = {(confidentiality, High), (integrity, High), (availability,
      High)}


      32


      Systems that do not involve a) intelligence activities, b) cryptologic activities
      related to national security, c) command and control of military forces, d)
      equipment that is an integral part of a weapon or weapons system or 5) information
      classified by an act of Congress or under an Executive order are not designated
      as national security systems if they are used exclusively for routine business
      or administrative applications even if they are critical to the direct fulfillment
      of military or intelligence missions. Routine business or administrative applications
      are defined as including payroll, finance, logistics, and personnel management
      applications. [Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002, Public Law

      Security Management involves the physical protection of an organization’s personnel,

      assets (e.g., nuclear power plants, dams, and other government facilities).
      Impact levels associated with security information directly relate to the potential

    Financial management involves the aggregate set of accounting practices and procedures
    that allow for the accurate and effective handling of all government revenues,
    funding, and expenditures. Confidentiality impacts associated with financial management
    information are generally associated with the sensitivity of the existence of
    specific projects, programs, and/or technologies that might be revealed by unauthorized
    disclosure of information. For integrity, temporary successful frauds can affect
    agency image, and corrective actions are often disruptive to agency operations.
    Permanent loss/unavailability of financial management information can cripple

      separate departments or agencies, or other entities, as appropriate. Since Information
      Sharing, as a function, is receiving and disseminating data [other information

      INFORMATION AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS

      In general, individual agencies should identify the mission information types
      processed by their systems. This Appendix identifies some information types
      that might be processed by Federal government organizations. The material includes
      mission information and potential impacts of unauthorized disclosure, modification,
      or unavailability of mission information.

      The primary purpose for Federal government information systems is to support
      provision of basic services to U.S. citizens and residents. This section addresses
      information types associated with both services provided by the Federal government
      to citizens and mechanisms used to achieve the purposes of government or deliver
      services for citizens. Delivery mechanisms include financial vehicles, direct
      government delivery, and indirect government delivery. Federal government missions
      or delivery mechanisms distributed among 26 mission areas and modes of delivery
      are identified in Table D-1. Each mission area and delivery mode corresponds
      to a Services to Citizens or Mode of Delivery business area as defined in the
      BRM described in the FEA Consolidated Reference Model Document Version 2.3.
      There is not a oneto-one mapping of services and delivery modes to government
      departments and agencies. Some departments and agencies focus on a single mission.
      Others support multiple missions within a mission area. Still others provide
      services associated with several different mission areas. An information type
      is associated with each Federal government mission and delivery mode. The identity
      of each information type is defined by the mission with which it is associated.
      Some of the management and support functions executed to support delivery of
      services or manage government resources are also executed by some agencies in
      delivering services to citizens. (See especially the “General Government” functions
      in Section C.2.8. of Appendix C) Most of these information types could be included
      in Appendix D as mission-based information types. Because the BRM categorizes
      them as services delivery support functions, they are included in Volume I,
      Section 4.1.2 and Appendix C and are not repeated in Appendix D.

      The common impact determination factors described in Volume I, Section 4.2.3
      and 4.4, also apply to mission-based information.



      The recommended information types provided in NIST SP 800-60 are established
      from the “business areas” and “lines of business” from OMB’s Business Reference
      Model (BRM) section of Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA) Consolidated Reference
      Model Document Version 2.3, dated October 2007.

      Table D-2 includes provisional impact assessments for each mission information
      type or delivery mode represented in Table D-1. In Table D-2, exceptions to
      provisional impact assignments are identified by displaying impact assignments
      in a gray font [gray font] and are described as applicable by security objective
      in the information type descriptions to follow. The specific descriptions are
      provided under the sub-heading “Special Factors Affecting [Security Objective]
      Impact Determination.

      Implementation Tip

      The impact levels assigned to several information types should be

      considered context-dependent. For example, a given information type in

      some agencies may include information elements, the compromise of

      which may endanger human life. In other agencies, the same information

      type may not include such elements.

      Many of the information types are also lifecycle-dependent. That is, information
      that requires protection at one stage in the system development process may
      be publicly accessible at a later stage or following some event. For example,
      information that has confidentiality attributes during the period that an agency
      is using it to make a decision may be public knowledge once the decision has
      been made (e.g., financial/budgetary information used during development of
      requests for proposals in procurement actions).

      The following sections describe information attributes that affect impact assessment
      for each information type.
