      Describe the macOS Server user settings used on {{hostname}} to limit access.

      * Are you using automatic deactivation of accounts after a period of no logins? (What is the expiration period?)

      * Are lockouts used after a certain number of failed logins? (How many failed logins triggers a lockout?)

      * MacOS X file sharing does not support multi-factor authentication so accounts are required
        to have long passwords (at least 14 characters). What is the password policy?

      ### macOS File Server

      MacOS X file sharing authentication is used.
      Credentials are transmitted over SSH, CIFS, or PEM and are stored in hashed
      form in a Unix /etc/shadow password file.

      {% if using_security_groups %}
      Users are segmented by security group. {{security_groups_description}}
      {% endif %}
