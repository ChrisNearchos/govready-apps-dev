    <p>A secure web application is partitioned to isolate its different parts.</p>

    <p>A secure web application uses various techniques to protect its internal
    and external communications.</p>

    <p>In this section we'll help you document how your application is partitioned and make sure you
    configuring your application to communicate securely.</p>

    <p>Completing this section will show you are doing things like encrypting communications with users and reducing risk from Denial of Service attacks.</p>

      A secure system is protected by a firewall.

      {% if project.system_stack.cloud_provider == "aws" %}
      Amazon Web Services's "security groups" are firewalls that protect machine instances in EC2.
      Besides the AWS security groups, does your system have an additional firewall?

      {% elif project.system_stack.application_where_hosted == "cloud" %}
      Cloud providers, such as {{project.system_stack.cloud_provider}}, often have firewall
      services built-in. Besides the firewall services provided by {{project.system_stack.cloud_provider}},
      does your system have an additional firewall?

      {% else %}
      Does your system have a firewall?

    title: How To Know That The Firewall Is Configured
    type: interstitial
    prompt: |
      A system security plan (SSP) should show evidence of a properly configured firewall.
      
      Good evidence for your SSP that your firewall is configured is a screenshot of the firewall
      configuration settings. Next, we will help you get that evidence.

      A secure system should be monitored for firewall activity.

      When did the person responsible for monitoring firewall activity last look at the log files of your system's firewall?
