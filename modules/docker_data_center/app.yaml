    ## Docker Enterprise Edition (Engine)

    'Before installing Docker Enterprise Edition, ensure that your
    supporting Linux operating system''s packager manager supports package
    signature verification and that it is enabled. It is also required
    that you import the Docker public key for CS packages so as to
    retrieve the validated and signed package from Docker, Inc. Refer to
    your Linux OS documentation for instructions on completing the above
    steps.

    In addition, Docker Content Trust is a capability provided by CS
    Docker Engine that enforces client-side signing and verification of
    Docker image tags. It provides the ability to use digital signatures
    for data sent to and received from Docker Trusted Registry and the
    public Docker Store. These signatures allow client-side verification
    of the integrity and publisher of specific image tags. When enabling
    Docker Content Trust in Docker Enterprise Edition you can enforce the
    use of signed Docker images. Additional information can be found at

    ## Docker Enterprise Edition (Engine)

    'All remote access sessions to Docker Enterprise Edition are protected with
    Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2 with the AES GCM cipher. In
    addition to this, all communication to and between Docker Enterprise Editions
    is enforced by way of two-way mutual TLS authentication.'
    ## Universal Control Plane (UCP)

    'All remote access sessions to Universal Control Plane are protected
    with Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2 with the AES GCM cipher. This
    is included at both the HTTPS application layer for access to the UCP
    user interface and for command-line based connections to the cluster.
    In addition to this, all communication to UCP is enforced by way of
    two-way mutual TLS authentication.'

    ## Docker Enterprise Edition (Engine)

    'On the underlying Linux operating system supporting Docker Enterprise
    Edition, only root and sudo users and users that have been added to
    the "docker" group have the ability to access the logs generated by
    UCP backend service containers. Should the organization decide to
    configure Docker Enterprise Edition to use a logging driver other than
    the default json-file driver, the organization is subsequently
    responsible for configuring the chosen logging stack per the
    provisions of this control. Additional information can be found at the
    following resources:

    - https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/overview/

    In addition, for Linux operating systems supporting Docker Enterprise
    Edition that use the systemd daemon, it is imperative that the Journal
    is secured per the requirements of this control. The same applies for
    Linux operating systems supporting Docker Enterprise Edition that
    instead use upstart.'
    ## Universal Control Plane (UCP)

    'By default, Universal Control Plane is configured to use the
    underlying logging capabilities of Docker Enterprise Edition. As such,
    on the underlying Linux operating system, only root and sudo users and
    users that have been added to the 'docker' group have the ability to
    access the logs generated by UCP backend service containers. In
    addition, only UCP Administrator users can change the logging endpoint
    of the system should it be decided that logs be sent to a remote
    logging stack. In this case, the organization is responsible for
    configuring the remote logging stack per the provisions of this
    control.'
