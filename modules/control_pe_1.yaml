    >   1. A physical and environmental protection policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, > and compliance; and
    >
    >   2. Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the physical and environmental protection policy and associated physical and environmental protection controls; and
    >
    > b) Reviews and updates the current:
    >
    >   1. Physical and environmental protection policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; and

    title: Parameter PE-1(a)
    prompt: |
      This control enhancement has a parameter:

      > The organization General Federal Agency:
      >
      > a) Develops, documents, and disseminates to **[Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]**
      >
      >   1. A physical and environmental protection policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, > and compliance; and
      >
      >   2. Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the physical and environmental protection policy and associated physical and environmental protection controls

      How often does the organization review and update the physical and environmental protection policy? Many systems specify annually or whenever there is a change in the threat environment.
