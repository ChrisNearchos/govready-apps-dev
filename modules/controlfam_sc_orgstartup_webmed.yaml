      A secure system is protected by a firewall.

      {% if project.system_stack.cloud_provider == "aws" %}
      Amazon Web Services's "security groups" are firewalls that protect machine instances in EC2.
      Besides the AWS security groups, does your system have an additional firewall?

      {% elif project.system_stack.application_where_hosted == "cloud" %}
      Cloud providers, such as {{project.system_stack.cloud_provider}}, often have firewall
      services built-in. Besides the firewall services provided by {{project.system_stack.cloud_provider}},
      does your system have an additional firewall?

      {% else %}

      A system security plan (SSP) should show evidence of a properly configured firewall.
      
      Good evidence for your SSP that your firewall is configured is a screenshot of the firewall
      configuration settings. Next, we will help you get that evidence.
