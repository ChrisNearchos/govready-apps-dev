    ## Naming your system

    Information systems benefit from having an official name, acronym/abbreviation and description. Standardized references make the system easier to track in documents and databases.

    An official system name, acronym/abbreviation and description will be needed for your SSP.

    Your organization may also require you to register your system and refer to it by an unique identifier.

    Let's document the names of the *{{project}}* system.
