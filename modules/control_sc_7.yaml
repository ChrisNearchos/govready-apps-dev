      A secure system is protected by a firewall.

      {% if 0 and project.system_basics.cloud_provider == "AWS" %}
      Amazon Web Services's "security groups" are firewalls that protect machine instances in EC2.
      Besides the AWS security groups, does your system have an additional firewall?

      > a. Monitors and controls communications at the external boundary of the system and at key internal boundaries within the system;

      > b. Implements subnetworks for publicly accessible system components that are [Selection: physically; logically] separated from internal organizational networks; and

        b.  Implements subnetworks for publicly accessible system components that are logically separated from internal organizational networks by configuring different security groups to establish logically separated subnetworks; and
        
        c.  Connects to external networks or information systems only through managed interfaces consisting of boundary protection devices arranged in accordance with an organizational security architecture by using {{project.system_basics.cloud_provider.text}} Security Groups which are required in {{project.system_basics.cloud_provider.text}} to connect to external networks (e.g., Internet) and other information systems.
