    ### Naming your system

    Information systems benefit from having an official name and nickname. Standardized references make the system easier to track in documents and databases.

    An official system name will be needed for your SSP.

    Your organization may also require you to register your system and refer to it by an unique identifier.

    Let's document the names of the *{{project}}* system.
